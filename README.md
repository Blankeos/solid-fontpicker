### 🟡 Status

Hi guys, I kinda got stuck on publishing. This port is 90% complete.

I got too confused with how to pre-generate fonts and allocating 20-30 minutes for it sounded too painful.

Anyway the current state of this is very similar to the original library at its
current state. I just copied the pre-generated `font-preview` dir for the package.

I also simplified the publish.yml (with my own using changeset) and commented the other workflows.

I definitely need help here! Feel free to make a PR
